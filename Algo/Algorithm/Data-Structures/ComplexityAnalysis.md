## Complexity Analysis

The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the
<b>time complexity</b> and the <b>space complexity</b> of an algorithm.

Complexity analysis is effectively used to determine how "good" an algorithm is and whether it's "better" than
another one.

## Time Complexity

A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in
coding interviews.

It's expressed using <b>Big O</b> notation.

## Space Complexity

A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of
algorithms and in coding interviews.

It's expressed using <b>Big O</b> notation.
