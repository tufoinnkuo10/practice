# Coding Skills

A coding interview for a coding job will naturally be testing your coding skills.

During the interview focus on fundamental coding skills like

1. Descriptive variable name is a must to do if you're coding in a whiteboard ask your interviewer if it's ok to abbreviate the variable name

2. Abstraction, by this I mean separating chunks of code in their own methods, making use of helper methods, remove duplicates.
   If you're coding on a whiteboard tell your interviewer that you'll write the entire algorithm and if you have time you will come back and complete the helper methods

3. Documentation is important in production-ready code and also during the interview. After you finishing the algorithm, you can leave a short comment that explains how the algorithm works.

4. Descriptive code

5. Idiomatic coding style I.e. "All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed."

"Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a style guide, and you should follow it"
Rebecca Murphey

"Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Ideaâ„¢. If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec."
Idan Gazit

6. Testing, if you are on a whiteboard you can just say aloud how you'll cover edges cases.

Myths: Simples mistakes like typos or cofusion with a language will not cause failure on a coding interview, (if they are not often)
