# Communication

Communication is an often overlooked yet very important aspect of coding interviews.

1. A lot of a software engineer's job is communication

2. Communication is pretty easy to assess during a coding interview

3. Discus the trade-off
   Don't let your interview guess why did you take that approach

4. Proactively ask for help and approval from your interviewer, but don't over do it
