# Waterfall Streams

  You're given a two-dimensional array that represents the structure of an
  indoor waterfall and a positive integer that represents the column that the
  waterfall's water source will start at. More specifically, the water source
  will start directly above the structure and will flow downwards.

  Each row in the array contains <span>0</span>s and <span>1</span>s, where a
  <span>0</span> represents a free space and a <span>1</span> represents a block
  that water can't pass through. You can imagine that the last row of the array
  contains buckets that the water will eventually flow into; thus, the last row
  of the array will always contain only <span>0</span>s. You can also imagine
  that there are walls on both sides of the structure, meaning that water will
  never leave the structure; it will either be trapped against a wall or flow
  into one of the buckets in the last row.

  As water flows downwards, if it hits a block, it splits evenly to the left and
  right-hand side of that block. In other words, 50% of the water flows left and
  50% of it flows right. If a water stream is unable to flow to the left or to
  the right (because of a block or a wall), the water stream in question becomes
  trapped and can no longer continue to flow in that direction; it effectively
  gets stuck in the structure and can no longer flow downwards, meaning that 50%
  of the previous water stream is forever lost.

  Lastly, the input array will always contain at least two rows and one column, 
  and the space directly below the water source (in the first row of the array)
  will always be empty, allowing the water to start flowing downwards.

  Write a function that returns the percentage of water inside each of the
  bottom buckets after the water has flowed through the entire structure.

  You can refer to the first 4.5 minutes of this question's video explanation
  for a visual example.

## Sample Input

<pre>
array = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
]

source = 3
</pre>

## Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
[0, 0, 0, 25, 25, 0, 0]

The water will flow as follows:
[
  [0, 0, 0, ., 0, 0, 0], 
  [1, ., ., ., ., ., 0], 
  [0, ., 1, 1, 1, ., 0], 
  [., ., ., ., ., ., .], 
  [1, 1, 1, ., ., 1, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, ., ., 0, 1], 
  [0, 0, 0, ., ., 0, 0], 
]
</pre>

## Hint 1

Try not to overthink the solution to this problem. If you were to manually go through an example of water flowing downwards through the waterfall structure, what steps would you follow exactly? Can you simply transcribe these steps into code?

## Hint 2

To start simple, consider how you would solve this problem if there were only two rows. How would you make water flow from the first row to the second row with your code? Can you make a slight modification to this approach in order to solve this problem for any number of rows?

## Hint 3

You'll want to traverse through the input array, all the while keeping track of where and how much water flows. To do this, you'll need to represent water with some value (-1, for example, to distinguish it from the other values in the array). Iterate through the input array, row by row, column by column, specifically looking at each current row and the row above it. When you see water in the row above, you'll have to reiterate through both the row above and the current row to see where the water will flow to next (i.e., whether there are open spaces allowing the water to flow sideways and / or downwards), mutating these rows along the way whenever water does flow. You'll have the make sure to keep track of the percentage of water that's flowing whenever water gets split in half.

## Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity

O(w^2 * h) time | O(w) space - where w and h are the width and height of the input array.
