# Calendar Matching

Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a
co-worker. You have access to your calendar and your co-worker's calendar
(both of which contain your respective meetings for the day, in the form of
[startTime, endTime]), as well as both of your daily bounds
(i.e., the earliest and latest times at which you're available for meetings
every day, in the form of [earliestTime, latestTime]).

Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your
co-worker's calendar, your co-worker's daily bounds, and the duration of the
meeting that you want to schedule, and that returns a list of all the time
blocks (in the form of [startTime, endTime]) during which you
could schedule the meeting, ordered from earliest time block to latest.

Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time. For
example: 8:30, 9:01, and 23:56.

Also note that the given calendar times will be sorted by start time in
ascending order, as you would expect them to appear in a calendar application
like Google Calendar.

## Sample Input

<pre>
calendar1 = [['9:00', '10:30'], ['12:00', '13:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']]
dailyBounds1 = ['9:00', '20:00']
calendar2 = [['10:00', '11:30'], ['12:30', '14:30'], ['14:30', '15:00'], ['16:00', '17:00']]
dailyBounds2 = ['10:00', '18:30']
meetingDuration = 30
</pre>

## Sample Output

<pre>
[['11:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]
</pre>

## Hints

### Hint 1

In order to find blocks of time during which you and your coworker can have a meeting, you have to first find all of the unavailabilities between the two of you. An unavailability is any block of time during which at least one of you is busy.

### Hint 2

You'll have to start by taking into account the daily bounds; the daily bounds can be represented by two additional meetings in each of your calendars.

### Hint 3

Once you've taken the daily bounds into account, you'll want to merge the two calendars into a single calendar of meetings and then flatten that calendar in order to eliminate overlapping and back-to-back meetings. This will give you a calendar of unavailabilities, from which you can pretty easily find the list of matching availabilities.

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

O(c1 + c2) time | O(c1 + c2) space - where c1 and c2 are the respective numbers of meetings in calendar1 and calendar2.
